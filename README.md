The Pushfish Android Client [![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-blue.svg?style=flat)](/LICENSE)
==========================
This is the pushfish android client. It's using MQTT to communicate with the server. The client is licensed 
under [BSD 2 clause][1] just like the rest of the project.

This is based on ![Pushjet](https://github.com/Pushjet/Pushjet-Android)

## Permissions explained
The [permissions][4] used by Pushfish might seem a bit broad but they all have a reason:

 - Read phone status and identity:
  - This is needed [to generate the device uuid ][5] that authenticates the device with the server.
 - Take pictures and videos:
  - This is needed to make sure we can scan QR codes to register new services.
 - Control flashlight/vibration and prevent phone from sleeping:
  - This makes sure we can receive notifications.
